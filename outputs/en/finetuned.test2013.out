In the modern digital world , electronic products are widely used in daily lives , such as Smart phones , computers and etc .
In workplaces , electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporation .
The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwide .
Some people have started to think of electronic products that can be further adapted to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performance .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) is one type of example that has currently been implemented .
In this essay , I will discuss whether surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) should be used or not to track people .
Personally , I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people .
Surveillance technology such as RFID can be operated twenty-four hours with the absence of operators to track down every detail about human activities .
For instance , in militaries which are of high importance , surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidence if anything is at fault .
In supermarkets where it is difficult to catch stealers , surveillance technology which makes records that can be replayed or detect stealers on the spot is superior to use .
The high accuracy in utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreements among people .
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance , the chance for them to follow rules and orders is high .
It is useful as it reduces the chances of wrong doings that may occur .
Therefore , surveillance technology makes our society more ordered .
Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what has happened in the past .
In the late nineteenth century , there was a severe air crash happening at Miami international airport .
The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off .
Sooner or later , the electric systems were short circuited . As a result , the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground at extremely high speed .
All passengers and pilots were died .
After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incident , police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence .
Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent them happening in the future , hence to save more lives .
In addition , if surveillance technology is even better developed , it can be used to detect the problem before the real accident has happened .
However , the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in the invasion of privacy .
People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally .
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance .
Therefore , surveillance technology provides convenience to society but makes it more inconvenient for individuals .
Therefore , surveillance technology can be used , but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life .
In general , surveillance technology benefits society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals ' lives .
I do not agree with this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
In this fast moving society , technology is always improving to catch up with the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army to track people down .
Although surveillance technology is an issue in invading human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
There are two points supporting this argument .
Firstly , security systems are improved in many areas , such as school campus or in the workplace .
Secondly , it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents .
Therefore , this technology should be used to track people .
Many of this surveillance is being implemented in the government sectors , military areas to enhance their security .
It can also be found in schools and workplaces .
It is useful to the government and the people in the law sector .
They can maintain social control and recognize threats .
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen .
In addition , it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed .
For example , intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices .
This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
In addition , it can also prevent theft .
This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist law enforcers such as the police to collect evidence of crime after it occurred .
This can increase the efficiency of solving crime and thus decreasing the amount of criminal acts on people .
With the help of video surveillance , the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased .
However , video surveillance may be a help to most sectors , but it can also be misused by many people .
Some may use it to peek or record something illegal .
For example , it could be installed in personal lockers to record other people 's moves and actions .
This technology could also be seen as invasion of humans ' privacy .
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched .
This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
If everyone is being watched unknowingly , it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded .
Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner .
It may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people do crime .
The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it .
The more people use it over us , the more power they will have on us .
We should respect that everyone has human rights and , without the other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
We do not want to be sued for infringing other people 's privacy . Therefore , before implanting any RFID , we should ask for each other 's consent .
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs .
And after all this scientific research results are applied to daily life , products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purposes , it is also used to track people by doing human implants .
It is unacceptable for some people in society . However , I think this application is necessary and provides society with a lot of benefits .
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people and may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
For example , there is always news in the newspaper , reports that some elderly people get lost in a certain place and their family are looking for him or her .
Family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly , and with the help of police officers , maybe they can find the elderly back , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country that has a population of about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
However , if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently .
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals ; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time .
Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children , which happens in many developing countries .
It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agencies that are doing business to trade the children .
For example , they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but do n't pay attention to the child , so that this kind of agency may bring the child to the mountain area and sell him or her for a good price .
Since this happens more often in a country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Since this may happen across the province , and without any clue about the path that the child may go through .
However , if the child has been installed with a tracking device , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
Not only will the details of the location be provided , but it also may lead to finding out the root of this kind of children 's trading agency and it helps to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening to any family .
Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family from losing their members , especially the elderly and the children , which need to be paid more attention to .
As the technology increasingly advances , many of the things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the ' impossible ' .
From the internet , email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is advancement to not only society but also the world 's achievements .
People 's lives have become increasingly convenient to almost luxury , thanks to the implementation of technology available for Man 's life .
However , such rapid advancement through technology can be extremely useful to our daily life ; it can also cause invisible or massive threats to our peaceful lives that can be out of our imaginations and estimations .
Today , the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go .
Take Singapore , for example , where these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places , from condominiums to housing development board houses , and even from school canteens to toilets .
Even with our applications on our Iphones or other smartphones , our iPad can easily reveal our locations .
Every move of us is being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology will not be easily available to the public and taken for granted .
On the other hand , I will also discuss whether the RFID will be utilized for good purposes .
I agree that RFID technology will not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
First , our privacy is at threat .
Though tracking devices such as the applications on our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast - paced lives , this can be a double edged sword .
We revealed our locations , for our friends to catch up with us , but we can never know who is watching us out there secretly .
Hackers become increasingly vicious , invading our computer system , now with radiofrequency tracking devices , this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons .
Every move of us is easily tracked .
This is very hazardous .
No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when it comes to appropriate handling and usage .
For example , this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police forces to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads to solving a case .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contribute to our scientific findings and research .
In this , I mean that we can input this device implanted into an animal or birds species , for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
It can benefit our mankind if appropriately used .
However , I think such a powerful device will not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of ' unintentional ' individuals .
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy .
RFID is used in many forms , for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
Over these years , it has helped humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also being used as a human implant or as a form of product .
These implants and products are also being used as surveillance tools .
For using it as a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
There are also medical tools that are more implanted into the human body for basic medical research .
Moreover , the use of RFID chips in tracking clothes was also a very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point .
When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of elink cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access to the transportation needs had been seen over the years .
This form also can be used as a tracking device where the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
As this information is being kept well by the operators where they encrypt the data and use it in the proper form .
This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usage and are misused for unlawful usage .
Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research is also being widely used in many countries .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it .
This form of tool does not harm , but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when it comes to emergency .
This important information may be needed to save a person 's life , where their medical history was all recorded on the chip .
Additionally , the service industry was also using it to track its clothes that were used by their employees .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of the logistical hassle .
Therefore , the usage of RFID chips was more useful to help the human in the basic needs or tasks that are required .
This form of tracking was also not harmful to any person , whereas much of these information was all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of a human race .
Therefore , I agree that the use of RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race has also been mentioned above .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , emerging technologies always contribute to human beings ' better living conditions .
For example , the Internet has bridged the distance among people globally .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which are brought up by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies can not be simply discarded .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about what the advantages it has made available to human beings .
It can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make better security of people 's lives .
For old people , if they are alone at home , one day , they want to go out for a walk .
If they have some accidents like a heart attack , the track of them will show there is something wrong .
People can get there as soon as possible to save them .
For young people , parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after school .
By investigating the track by the surveillance technology , they can easily figure out where their kids are now and know roughly what they are doing .
On the other hand , due to the lack of people , the police can better know a person 's daily schedule .
It gives the police a better control of the criminal .
All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track and make the environment safer .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people 's lives more convenient and identifiable .
Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the same one as the one on the ID cards .
If we have these technologies , it will automatically confirm people 's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they can even need not to bring any money along with them .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Based on the identifiable environment , a lot of conventional ways or styles of human life can be changed .
For privacy concerns , if technology can be made to adjust to a human being 's feeling , it will be more welcome .
For example , if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location , he or she can disable the track .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to the public .
Once it is very severe , the records will be pop out for official use .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages to using surveillance technology to track people .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .
Besides , we can try to reduce the bad effects caused by the new technology .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) can be used to track people .
I do not agree with the above statement .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people even though there do exist many problems if it prevails .
This can help to regulate people 's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
Without sending back any images or sound records , RFID is more user - friendly and helps prevent users ' privacy at the best it can .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
The tags can be used on those who need to be taken care of their beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lose her .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at their friends ' home , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behavior .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Everyday crimes are happening from time to time , and helping to keep a low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts .
Police can put tags on those that have potential intention of committing crime .
Thus , when a man with a ' terrorism tag ' entering a junction or a plaza full of people , police should notice this and observe the man 's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
What is more , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
If RFID is used on everyone and running for years , the surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistical data showing the movement of people from city to city , from town to town , which is expanding more than people thought , and which city is becoming less attractive .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs of each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures , what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made .
Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local governments as well as the whole country .
As for transportation , roads and traffic authorities can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living in .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic databases for various uses .
But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives .
It is undeniable that technology has made our lives and works easier and more efficient .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violate the privacy of people instead of being used in a more beneficial way towards people , it is my opinion , that such technology should rethink its way of existence .
In fact , people are becoming more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world through the internet .
Social networks such as Facebook , Twitter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being released .
This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by talking about people 's privacy openly , which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
Such an incident happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV ( CCTV ) on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching of people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
Instead , when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper , it was heavily criticised by the public .
People were claiming the loss of privacy .
The government had to install all the devices in the end .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way . However , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .
From the point of humanity , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings .
We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods . It is easy to trade when they are all labelled and tagged .
However , human beings are not animals or any other products , they have their own thoughts and freedom .
They have full control of their own lives .
If so , then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like ?
It is understandable that once people have human implants , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out .
However , this way of curbing crimes is so violent that it will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such a device .
After all , there will be an endless battle between technology and human mentality .
Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing .
Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets .
However , in countries like China , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets , pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets .
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive . However , it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as " human beings " , our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom .
This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harm to someone , people still prefer to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom .
Even if pets are granted freedom , people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential .
In conclusion , I think that surveillance technology should not be allowed to be used to track people .
It does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects , but also cause leakage of personal information .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays .
Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectors .
Example of this technology is RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) , which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people .
However , this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons .
I personally stand together with the population who reject the proposal .
First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .
Human rights have been raised pretty frequently in the world over the past few years .
Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom .
Would n't it be similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?
Secondly , the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue .
The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone .
It represents a query : is n't everyone able to view each other 's information , such as name and age ?
The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue for personal safety , violation of freedom and breakdown of safety .
One of the examples is the storage of bank account numbers in the tracking chip .
Criminals could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved .
He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .
Other than that , safety issues can be extended to personal safety .
Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point , such as Facebook .
However , people tend to express their personal feelings and ideas about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally .
This action could actually generate aggressive feelings from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tags or implants .
The Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of a person if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of a designated person .
In addition , the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .
The technology is based on the chip implant or tag .
However , the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag .
Mischief cases could actually cause chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it unintentionally .
For example , a wanted person can escape easily from a country and hide in another country by this method .
This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose .
In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .
However , it is fairly fragile which can be counterused by criminals at the current level .
I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present .
Nowadays , the improved human technology online is able to track different locations for different people .
For instance , Facebook , as the well known social media platform , has the ability to track someone 's location .
However , in some opinions , these autotracking services break the rule of privacy .
Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service .
There are various advantages to using the surveillance technology .
The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent them from losing them .
We all know that there is an application on the iphone called where my iphone is .
It basically served to allocate your phone 's position at any single time . For instance , if someone left his phone in a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends ' device .
You are able to find the location of your lost iPhone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never been there before .
For example , one person wants to visit his friends ' place in a new city .
His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology .
Then , the person is able to use GPS or other autotracking devices to find the place even though he has never gone to there before .
The radiofrequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
For instance , when people get old , they begin to lose their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other places .
If the old people always bring an autotracking device , it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
Although the autotracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used in volunteering bases .
Without the agreement , people should not be able to use this technology to track others .
For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers , this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online .
These kinds of situations will cause crime as thieves may also track you and you are not able to run out of them .
Therefore , we must agree with the statement before technology is able to track us .
At the same time , our location should be protected from being seen by strangers .
All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees to track him , like the time of tracking and who can view your location .
In conclusion , advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety .
At the same time , people must protect their privacy without sharing their place with strangers .
Overall , the benefit of these technologies outweighs its problems if people use it wisely .
The increase in the population of a country makes the government more difficult to register the members of each individual family and hence other factors exist as an obstacle to country development .
By following the trend of improvement in technology , people can now easily be tracked by using RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) by simply implanting RFID tags on the human body .
With this advantage , it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lose contact or in an urgent situation and also for police to investigate crimes .
By taking an example in any country , there are crimes every day and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits have been arrested and punished .
There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that is acquired by kidnappers .
In that case , they would have no choice but to seek for the power of local police .
The detective will start investigating the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities .
Reality kills people in mind .
There is only 10 % of all the time of successfully pinpointing the kidnappers and then arrested all of them before they start to harm the poor victim .
In that sense , without a proper way to track human beings , it is way too difficult to save those innocent lives .
Also , not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down , but also jailbreakers .
Few years ago , there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat , one of the members of the terrorists of Osama , who successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore .
That was a rare case since Singapore is actually an absolutely safe country .
According to news reports , the police force had mobilized thousands of cops , each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after a few months , none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and arrested him .
People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but to keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode .
If RFID comes into existence , this kind of case can be totally avoided in no time .
Besides , if RFID is supposed to be used by the public , everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family .
Nowadays , people use the opposite smart phone for communicating .
With the power of the internet , there is nothing impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea .
In spite of that , the smart phone is still a device that needs to be recharged with its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object .
Imagine when people camping in forest or hills , they would just lose all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone was running out of batteries .
In that case , if they get lost or lose contact , they will be considered as the lost and , eventually , they will not survive .
With the help of RFID , if there is an urgent need for people crying for help , they would be saved .
In conclusion , RFID benefited people more than brought harmful side effects to the human body by considering for human safety .
Nowadays , technology is more advanced than in the past .
In the past , people can only find each other and communicate face to face .
After the invention of the phone and internet , there are more ways to use it to communicate with people and even track people .
In this time , surveillance technology is founded , which means that we are able to track people at any time anywhere .
Definitely , there are points of view that agree with technology but also the voices of objection .
Thus , let 's discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer view of surveillance technology .
Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .
It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
Besides that , many animals which have just been released from the protection of humans for a long time have implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they can survive in the wild .
This technology is encouraged by some of the public that want to implant the RFID into prisoners ' body .
The initial function is good indeed , to track the movement of them to protect public safety and interest if they are out of prison .
However , some of the nongovernmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners ' body .
Their opinions are founded on basic human rights .
Prisoners ' privacy is endangered due to the RFID .
After their release from prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .
They feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine .
Furthermore , some parents hold positive views on surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children 's body .
Their opinion is based on the children 's safety protection and parents ' guardianship .
Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
However , there are both sides of stories .
This technology leads to a problem which is the same with the prisoner issue that is human privacy .
Children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible for taking good care of them .
Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children , however , children also have the human rights and privacy which are endangered under this technology .
Besides taking tags into the human body , there is also the issue of implanting them into products .
Recently , many cell phones are equipped with GPS , which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .
It is also the advance of surveillance technology .
Children can easily be tracked based on the location of cell phones by parents .
Compared to the human implant , tags on the products are better and more suitable .
Under the product tags , children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implants .
Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as do not endanger their privacy .
It is the way that we can " use one stone to kill two birds " .
In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
However , to a certain extent , I agree to implant RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .
As the world 's pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .
To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency .
For example , UPS can track the process of each delivery .
With information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company .
RFID is one of the most advanced technology for tracking .
Due to the small size of the equipment and the energysaving feature , it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics .
However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watches or clothes . It did provide convenience in a certain situation .
The biggest difference between humans and animals or any other objects is that we have self - esteem or we need the basic respect from our peers .
One of the basic rights of human beings is the right to privacy .
In any period of time , as long as we do not offense others , we should enjoy the right of privacy .
However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy .
Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposes which are not related to the industrial production or supply activities .
For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .
As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have access to the information can definitely track him .
However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , so this action could reveal the sensitive information of consumers , like home address , working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information .
If this piece of information is misused , chances are high that the consumer will suffer losses like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer .
Moreover , if the product is what one needs to use every day , like clothes or shoes , then the location of one will be revealed every second .
This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .
It is not only scary but also illegal .
Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose , it is still not appropriate .
We can think about this scenario : the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second .
Does this sound reasonable to you ?
As we have mentioned above , as a human being , we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others .
However , RFID will violate our right of privacy during our shopping activities .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track people no matter through human implants or tags on products .
Does society need surveillance or not ?
With the developing of modern society , more and more new technology appears and people 's qualities rise because of the new inventions .
Some good examples such as the Internet , computers and satellites are now quite common for humans ' normal life . However , some problems also emerge , with a concern about the loss of the privacy of civilians .
In modern society , privacy is a hot topic in peoples ' minds .
Even if safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life , many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of some potential danger .
The contradiction of safety and privacy can not be reconciled perfectly .
With the installing of surveillance cameras for every corner of Singapore , people 's lives have a safe security , and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments .
A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world .
This is because of two reasons : one is the strict law in Singapore , and the other is the dense surveillance everywhere .
During the year 2003 , surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation .
At that time , the Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillance cameras in every patient 's home to look after their actions .
Much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in Singapore .
Without the use of surveillance , the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly , and the loss caused by SARS might be many times greater than that in 2003 in Singapore .
The benefits of surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS , and this is a success example of the surveillance .
Every coin has its two sides .
In one way , surveillance helps the government guard civilians ' property and life . In the other way , surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under 24 hours ' monitoring .
In the 1984 novel , written by George Orwell , the author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they are doing everything .
Every word people say can be heard by the government and because of that , the government knows well about everyone 's mind and wants to wash everyone 's mind and control normal people totally .
It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel .
In reality , people are afraid of being tracked everywhere , not because of the meaning of crime , but because the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone 's heart .
When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife , none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors .
Normal people 's privacy needs government seriously considered about .
People need a safe environment to live in , and also need a private environment to stay independent .
surveillance is a useful method to keep society safe , but also kills the privacy of people of some degree .
The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life , and then surveillance is no more needed .
At that time , even if there is no surveillance above people 's heads , there are surveillances in everyone 's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide .
Nowadays , humans live in a modern society .
Around people , there is a lot of high technology , like CCTVs , automatically sorting systems for goods and different information systems .
In order to bring more benefit and ensure people 's safety , surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL , these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods .
It is convenient for customers to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .
However , besides tracking goods for people , people begin to use this technology to track people .
I do not agree with this kind of behavior , because humans are different from goods , and can not treat humans as goods .
There is no doubt the tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age .
No matter where people go , taking a bus or MRT , people are under CCTVs , it is very important and useful to track and find people .
Actually , the tracking system has provided people with safety indemnification .
However , tracking people is difficult and different from goods .
For instance , a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another .
Goods are dead , but humans are alive .
If one company really uses this technology to track their employees , employees will dislike and claim that their humans ' right and privacy have been violated .
In another word , people will feel that the boss of the company treats them like goods , because modern people need more homage , not money .
So , when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system , they will find some ways to escape the tracking system , like asking friends to help them to punch the cards .
Finally , the company tracking system has no meaning at all . Therefore , the tracking system is a very terrible measure to control people .
In addition , tracking people 's systems may be used by bad people in the wrong way .
How to explain this problem , it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking systems .
For example , people go somewhere , no matter taking a bus , MRT or driving , they are under CCTV .
If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes , by hacker technology , they can use a government tracking system to do their own business .
In other words , the government originally hopes to use a tracking system to ensure citizens ' safety . Now it has been divulging human information .
It is very dangerous for society , because people do not know who are tracking them , it must bring citizens trepidation .
In conclusion , as I have mentioned above , we have to agree , the tracking system has many benefits in different parts of human life , especially in this modern world .
But tracking people is a very terrible choice . It sounds like people invented a ' prison ' to jail themselves , people need homage and freedom .
Also , tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men for a not good purpose .
So Surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Surveillance technology : A prospering technology
Radiofrequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radiofrequency electromagnetic fields .
After this , it can automatically get the identification and tracking .
Nowadays , this technology has been used in many kinds of fields , such as transportation and logistics , transportation payment , product tracking and inventory systems , some institutions and so on .
More interestingly , this technology is being used in human identification , even planting the chip into the human body .
This fact becomes very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information releasing without knowing also brings the public 's concern .
In some fields , Surveillance technology did have brought us tremendous benefit and advantage .
Logistics and transportation are major areas of utilization for RFID technology .
In transportation , almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport .
Since we do not have to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee , enormous time has been saved for everybody .
For society , there will be a more efficient transportation system .
For logistics , if all the products are attached to the tags , it is much easier to count and record all the products .
This will make the logistics process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product loss because of the tracking .
Since inventory management is very important for some kinds of companies , this technology is playing a very significant role .
The supermarkets are also using this technology to tag their products , which can record the conditions of all of the products on time and prevent them stealing .
When checking out , the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly .
This will save customers time and also improve the profit of the market .
The libraries also use this technology to identify the membership of the people entering , which ensures the security and the member itself will also conserve their information made in this library .
Both the library and museum apply this technology to avoid some belongings being taken out illegally .
In some kindergartens , the RFID is used to tab the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts .
On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self - consciousness , this system can prevent them from getting lost .
All in all , the RFID system is used to catch the information of the object and track it .
This function can be used in many ways .
By RFID , the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it is lost , because the RFID can help them get it back .
This will inversely improve the sale of the shop .
Although in many respects , this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some areas it is so controversial .
The most controversial part may be human identification .
It probably can be divided into several types .
The first type is just say the ID card , which is carried externally by the person .
By using this card , our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept .
However , this will raise a privacy protection issue .
How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused ?
Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology .
For example , the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner .
When not using it , just switch off the card , then it will be just a useless paper .
Another human identification is implanting RFID chips into the human body .
For this part , not only the privacy problem is concerned , but the human health .
Does the implanting chip definitely be safe and feasible ?
Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs ?
All of these problems are waiting to be resolved .
In solution , surveillance technology has been used in a much broader area .
Some have been widely accepted by the public but some are not .
Actually , this technology is very useful and should definitely go on to be used .
What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in the right way .
If there are some controversy , how can it be improved ?
Only if it can be made use in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly , can it bring us the maximized benefit .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people .
Technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigations and social issues and decrease illegal actions effectively .
Firstly , surveillance technology is useful in crime investigation and public issues .
It can provide an objective view of what happened .
It records the history which nobody can deny .
In crime investigations , the truth of evidence is necessary , which can only be made by photos , videos or small tracks .
A supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves .
In front of the ATM we need to monitor and avoid international crime .
We need CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious behaviour .
Only in this way can we get evidence of bad movement to protect others .
The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in the crime investigation , better than asking witnesses again and again to identify who is the liar .
Secondly , surveillance technology can decrease illegal actions effectively .
Imagine there is no CCTV in public .
People will act as if there is no supervision .
No evidence is recorded .
Cheating can be very popular in examination and stealing will seldom incur punishment .
In a Chinese kindergarten , children were always abused by a teacher , but no one else knows that .
Children told their parents .
Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said .
The headmaster did not know how the teacher really is and she did not fire her even when some children were afraid of entering the teacher 's class .
After so many children were abused , people came to know the truth .
Shadow was made in children 's heart and there is nothing we can do to make up for it .
Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a monitor , otherwise the teachers ' action can not be supervised .
If there had been a monitor in the classroom , maybe parents and headmasters could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier .
People may say that surveillance technology will be abused intentionally by authorized people .
It really happened in China .
In a car accident related to an official 's relative , the record was modified with a new record .
The person on the record had been charged with another one before it was released to the public .
The modification was so obvious that people can easily recognize .
In China , things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough .
Power is concentrated on a few people .
The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power .
Avoiding corruption and separating power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology .
In conclusion , surveillance technology is necessary in many public places , in my opinion , because we need it in crime investigation and social issues .
There is a truth that we can not deny , which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes the machine is more honest than people .
We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depends on a sound legal system , and it means surveillance has its own restriction .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) has been made possible to track people by implanting certain markers on people or products .
This is more than convenient for the authority to take better control of society down to every individual .
However , with respect of civil rights and privacy , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) will not be used to track people .
In the first place , every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being closely watched every second .
By law , citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknown to the public , whereas privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely .
Many pupils in China have been complaining about their phones , because with the phones in their hands , their lives are all transparent to their parents .
Such technology would put people into the same circumstances as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second .
If pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents , citizens definitely are unhappy being watched by their big brother .
Close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feelings , but also a problem of the health of society .
Some people may claim that it is good for security as when everyone is under tracking , those potential criminals also are .
By logic it seems perfectly right .
However , whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authorities .
When the authority treats liberty as a crime , society becomes terrible .
It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in .
Many science fictions have made good efforts in describing the future of humans in which everybody in society is put under close surveillance by governments .
Surprisingly , none of these are describing the future as a bright one .
In history , there were times when the government wanted to secure its government so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs , such as the Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union .
People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies .
Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies ?
A worse thing is that one may not even be aware of that he or she is being tracked .
If such a thing does happen , then society will be moving in a dangerous direction without being noticed .
Imagine that one day , one is suddenly arrested from his normal life by the police and told that he is accused of posting antisociety statements on the Internet .
And all the evidence could have been collected by hidden surveillance when he thought he was expressing his opinion on the safe house .
In summary , surveillance technology will not be used to track people in order to keep society comfortable and safe to live in .
What should really be put into close surveillance is the government .
People must make sure that the government is not abusing its power in ways including tracking people .
There is one thing that is common in the world described in many fiction - chips are implanted in humans and records its location , history and even thoughts at that time .
The readers are just smiling when they flip the page because it never comes to their mind that one day it might come true .
However , the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us down .
Actually , this technology has already been weaved into our life .
We benefit from Surveillance technology for many years and in many ways .
Travelers survive in desert thanks to GPS guide them .
The police seize the criminal thanks to CCTV .
Having power can help people to achieve lots of things . However , abusing will guide us to another direction .
Tracking people is one way of abusing technology and , in fact , it happened every day .
Although we are not implanted chips , we are exposed under CCTV .
It is a common question asked by lots of people that , as technology develops and we benefit from it , we are losing our privacy .
We can not deny that Surveillance technology is a great achievement in securing us and protecting us from criminals , but we also can not ignore the lease of our privacy and even limit our freedom .
My life now is exposed to lots of CCTV .
Every day when I opened my door and went to lady 's house through the corridor , I was recorded by 3 CCTV .
I need to dress up neatly in case one day someone checks the CCTV and will find a girl in weird clothing .
When I work , it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relaxing in working time .
Next minute , I may have a tea with my manager .
Such a nightmare owes to abuse of Surveillance technology .
Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used to protect us from criminals , nowadays , it seems to be abused too much .
According to the article Lawful Interception , in the US , every telecommunication company has a contract with the FBI , requiring them to keep the phone call record easily searchable and accessible for the FBI .
Moreover , as showed in many Hollywood movies , Google mail is also accessible for the FBI .
There are so many people in the FBI , although it is under strict rule , and we can not think ideally there will not be anyone abusing its power and accessing those resources for private purposes and letting them out .
Leasing of private information , even though it only happened one time , but one is too many for an individual .
Moreover , the money spent on telephone call records is $ 1.8 million per year .
" The Big Brother is watching you " ( Orwell , " 1984 " ) , the fictional world described in George Orwell 's novel , now turns out to be true .
There is only one thing different .
Our life is not only exposed to big brother .
Instead , owing to CCTV , telephone and other RFID , we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone , but we seldom notice it . That is why it is horrible to our life .
As the fast growing use of electrical technology , people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our lives to make full use of it .
Many advantages have been shown in areas like politics .
Because of the surveillance technology , more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used .
However , disadvantages have also gradually disappeared , as with the fruits people are enjoying .
That is to say , there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology .
From the view of my point , I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security .
Firstly , privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring .
We can not imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor .
That sounds like we are naked in front of the public , there is no secret and even privacy for us .
Perhaps that surveillance is installed for the sake of safety , but actually it conversely makes us have a lack of safety .
Therefore , the surveillance technology can not be casually used .
Secondly , it may be used by lawbreakers .
There is no denying that every coin has two sides .
The technology also applies .
On one side , we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes .
On the other hand , the technology can also probably be used by the lawbreaker to commit crimes .
And once this happens , privacy does not exist any more and people 's lives are under great threat .
Therefore , this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that have appeared .
Thirdly , it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life .
Say , a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month .
And he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house .
Then if his house got stolen , perhaps he could use the surveillance to get his money back .
However , if nothing happened inside his house , then the surveillance becomes useless , and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised .
Therefore , for ordinary people , there is no need for them to use this technology .
Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .
For the reasons above , we can see that surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily life .
However , we can take the essence and reject its troops .
That is to say , we can use it in some specific and special areas , such as public security and politics .
These fields are special because of the job category , and the need to be open to the public , so the disadvantages will not be shown .
Contrary , it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs .
Surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population is potentially a dangerous weapon by the government against its own people .
It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracy .
Using surveillance technology such as RadioFrequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as the identification cards .
A possible benefit is better statistical analysis , which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies .
However , in this very nondeal world where corruption is abundant , wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous , perverted and deadly weapon .
Illustrations that is both hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies , such as the Bourne identity .
In the movie , the spy agent accesses the public street cameras to track Jason Bourne 's whereabouts .
This clearly illustrates how a corrupt government may breach its civilians ' privacy .
In addition , corrupt officials may sell this tracking information to the mafia .
Misha ( 2008 ) explains in his book ' MacMafia ' that the shadow market accounts for 20 % of the global economy .
Judging from the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters , human traffickers , and the yukuza from his book , it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human beings taking on this marvelous tracking technology .
The people who are on the run from the mafia will be at risk until
Surveillance technologies should also not be used to protect people 's liberty and freedom of opinion .
The idea of democracy and the power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked .
The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret polices .
Already without these technologies , the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels .
An example is the Nazis secret police of Hitler used to dispose ( their bodies literally ) and stamp out any of Hitler 's oppositions using fear ( and maybe guns , knives , poison ) .
As previously mentioned , there are benefits to this surveillance and tracking technology .
Trends of the highly emotionally and easily manipulated humans can be tracked , analysed , archived and chronicled .
Trends of society and cultures can therefore be observed as a function of time .
These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies .
An example of making a good informed decision is the story of the planning and construction of a walking path , where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people need a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a random location .
However , they could have built a walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves .
Knowing that this is the most favorable route for people , the government now has sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefits the people .
Still , the possible downfall of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly outweigh the benefits , in my opinion .
It is therefore better to stick to the status quo .
With the development of technology , we have more advanced methods to track people in today 's society .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious .
However , the use of surveillance technology is usually done secretly , and a debate has been aroused today about whether surveillance technology should be abandoned .
Some socialists argue that installing surveillance devices on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned .
However , people who are taking a security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively .
In my point of view , surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present , since there are no better solutions .
The application of surveillance technology is the most effective method to track people and this can help the police a lot .
Although that method may invade certain people 's rights and privacy , but in exchange for that , we can get a safe and peaceful society .
If the surveillance technology is abandoned , it makes the police very difficult to track suspicious people and can have little control over those people who are dangerous to society .
For example , without surveillance technology , the murders can escape much more easily , since no one knows their position .
Without surveillance technology , suspicious people might actually commit murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police can not arrive in time to help out .
On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder , since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police .
If that technology is abandoned , it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or steal things , since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law .
Therefore , the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary .
Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned , regulations on using that are expected .
With the popularization of surveillance technology , a more concise and more complete regulation of using that is highly needed .
For example , making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to ordinary people so that abuse of surveillance technology can be avoided , which is also an effective way to protect human rights .
Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders of people suspected .
With proper use of surveillance technology , surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police , and also benefit all society .
It is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invades human rights . However , for the sake of whole society , surveillance technology should still be used .
As long as the regulations for using that are obeyed , surveillance technology can serve as a good tool .
In modern society , public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon .
In the United States , after the horrible attack on 11 September , the US congress passed the Patriot Act , which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance , to counter attacks against terrorists .
However , although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again , the act is widely criticized for its violation of individual privacy .
With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID , spy on the population can be much easier , which will create even worse scenery for the citizens .
In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .
First , the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .
Typically , the RFID tags are small devices with a ready chip .
The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters .
Once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals , all the information about his or her life can be recorded .
Some supporters may argue that it will be more convenient to use RFID for identification in places like airports and checkpoints .
However , the fact is that such technology will create checkpoints everywhere .
Furthermore , such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person .
That is to say , people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness .
In such a situation , individuals will lose their basic privacy .
Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .
An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .
Since it is readonly , the card can not protect itself .
Moreover , almost everyone can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .
Then , if a businessman wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .
Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
Third , using surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authorities .
The government is supposed to serve the people .
However , once the government gathers too much power , democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and such surveillance technology provides the measures .
Spying and collecting excessive information from individuals is the first step .
When the government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually apply control over them .
Consequently , the government is very likely to turn out to be a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .
All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track the general population for the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authorities .
Privacy must be respected , and power over others should be controlled .
Without such surveillance technology , we can still live a better future .
With the development of science and technology , people nowadays are living under various surveillances . For example , CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in the public area .
Recently , a new common surveillance technology called radiofrequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people .
Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration .
However , as far as I am concerned , using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
During scientific exploration , especially the geographical ones , tracking is very important .
This tracking will help scientists to better get their results and clear exploration route information will also be useful for postresearch when scientists come back .
In addition , people who research on biodiversity will also need to be tracked .
When these scholars are on the field journey , they also have to relate their observations with their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .
In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .
Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas .
Their safety may face huge challenges .
For this kind of situation , RFID will help a lot .
Actually , not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling , RFID can defend human beings from harm .
Firstly , knowing where the travelers are and may be going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger .
Furthermore , by telling the geographical position of the people , RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims .
During the rescue , every second is valuable ,
RFID is also functional in police events .
By getting the track of the suspects , police officers can decide who the criminal is exactly sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event .
Furthermore , knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .
Policemen can just go to a certain place and chase the criminal .
Besides , tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem .
Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals ' privacy .
Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues .
Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescue and police events , the privacy factors are far less important than individual or social safety and scientific results .
In addition , for observation journeys and traveling , we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit .
Above all , I think we can not ban the use of RFID completely , since it will be of great help for humans ' benefit during scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
By using this technology reasonably , it will help people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization - developing path .
Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology
With the development of science and technology , surveillance technology is playing its role in people 's lives .
It monitors anybody 's movement or activity , and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law , etc .
When surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our lives , some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe .
Personally , I think surveillance technology such as RFID ( radiofrequency identification ) should not be used to track people , but for the benefit it brings to me , it can not match the concerns it causes .
It has been quite a long time since someone raises the importance of the right of privacy .
Without doubt , surveillance technology is going against the right , since it leaks out people 's information without getting their permission .
When technology is not so well developed , it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information .
While , as it becomes highly developed , it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where you go and what did you do .
It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie , and you are the hero whose every movement , including using the toilet , is under other observation , just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show , which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world , broadcast to billions of people .
When I have such feelings , I will feel that I am not belonging to human beings as everyone else any longer . Instead , I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others .
It is more like a prisoner 's life , because we are under other people 's control and we can do nothing to change our situation .
On the other hand , when we allow surveillance technology to be used to track people , it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions .
For example , thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time they are informed of everyone 's location .
That will also cause more social concerns .
However developed our society is , technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes .
Every technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings , just like nuclear power or weapons .
If we can not choose the proper way to use it , we taste the bad consequences of it .
As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our quality of life but also violating our right of privacy , I think we should not use it to track people .
All of us hope to live in a freer , more relaxed and safer world .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon as shown in China , India , Europe and even more countries and regions .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted in population ages ; a high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people .
However , it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in the workforce .
Rising life expectancies is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement .
Rising life expectancies result in fewer workforces available .
Fewer young people and more elderly people have existed globally .
This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people .
This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries , and hence affects the productivity of the world .
Globally , manpower is lacking .
Although the current world is a digital world in which more machines are used to replace manpower , manpower is required to operate these machines so that they can better function .
In countries like Singapore , manpower is the only natural resources available which Singapore can invest in as she does not have enough land to build farms and factories .
In addition , Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which is mainly consisting of services .
People are needed .
More importantly , Singapore wants to be a knowledge - based country , where more highly educated people are required .
Ageing results in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion .
More elderly people are a burden on society as more funds are required by the government to support their standard of living .
In general , elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults .
More healthcare is needed for elderly people than young adults .
In most countries , healthcare is provided freely by the government .
As a result , governments need more taxes from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
This is an age when most people are retired and has no sources of income .
Their purchasing power is low .
In an aged population , low spending affects economic growth .
Companies are in trouble if they can not earn sufficient money to sustain their business and they also need to pay high taxes to the government .
Population ageing is a challenge for economic development .
Despite the challenges of the ageing population , it is an achievement as fewer people are in competency to bid for a job position .
Therefore , people are generally less stressed about working .
Life is more enjoyable for young adults .
Rising life expectancies also indicate that standard of living is improved for the majority of people .
Healthcare is better than in the past .
They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health in a better condition .
In conclusion , rising life expectancies is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development .
However , it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society has progressed well and people are living in better conditions .
With the ageing population , many countries are facing the same challenge as building safety houses , facilities to cater to the old age .
After a certain age , they will have to retire .
The challenge of many ageing countries will rise when no new generation can take over their place in that particular trade .
First , I will discuss the challenge of having an ageing population , such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over , which can lead to economic downfall .
Secondly , I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement where they implement healthy lifestyles and good eating habits .
When people start to age , many diseases will surface up unnoticed .
Therefore , for the welfare of the ageing population , more old age hospitals will have to be built .
Land space will be limited when more hospices are built to take care of the elderly people .
With illnesses surfacing and the increase in the ageing population , an increasing amount of nurses and doctors will have to be present .
However , not many young people are passionate about helping society or even helping the elderly .
Hence , the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly .
In addition , retirement is a must in some countries .
This could cause a drastic fall in their economy , as if the younger generation could not take over their work , no one would continue .
It is thus a big challenge to the country as there is no one boosting their economy .
The ageing population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to have a healthy lifestyle by the people .
The more old people the country has , the more experience they will be , as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and make them not make the same mistakes as them .
This will help the country to move forward rapidly .
The more exercise or any other forms of workout can prolong the lifespan of people .
It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death , thus living longer .
Food can be a big part of our lives .
Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan .
An example will be in Korea .
It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and , in addition , people will have a good skin complexion .
True enough , their population is ageing , but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming .
Thus , food can play an important role for the population .
As life could be precious , an ageing population could be an advantage as well as a disadvantage to a particular country .
A balanced phenomenon should be seen in one nation .
Rising life expectancies could be seen as a good or a bad trend for others .
Therefore , every country should try to keep both the young and the older generation balanced .
Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer , which reflects the rising of life expectancies .
It is clear that population aging is happening all over the world , since the current average life span is 65 and the population above the age of 60 is getting increased year after year .
This shows the rising level of life expectancies , it is an achievement and it is also a challenge .
The rising life expectancy may be due to several different reasons . For example , it may be because of the improvement of the living condition , or because of the upgrade of the cleanness of the living environment , or because of the wide range of nutrition that is absorbed by humans , or because of the development of the medication system in the country .
No matter which reason stated above is exactly dominant to the rising standard of life expectancies , it is one of the evidence of the achievement of the human nation .
It is the technology that enables the improvement of the living condition ; the discovery of food and nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for humans to absorb ; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases .
Without all this technology , we may need to live in the same condition as centuries ago , with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and human nations have no solution .
The rising standard of life expectancies shows the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so many centuries . Therefore , it is an achievement .
However , the rising of life expectancies is also a challenge to the entire human nation .
With the ageing population problem getting more and more serious all over the world , the shortage of various kinds of resources challenges most of the countries in the world .
First , food resources and education are the most important things to support the living human beings .
And also , the overcrowded modern cities also raise the problem of public transportation , unevenly distributed wealth and education resources shortages are also the problems that some countries may face too .
Although the rising level of life expectancy is a challenge to the entire human nation , the detailed problems each country will encounter is different .
It is clear that problems that may arise for developed and developing countries are different .
For developing countries , they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and the problem of how to develop a better education system to serve the entire nation , and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population . Moreover , they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country .
For developed countries , the challenges they face mainly are the overcrowded modern cities that usually face public transportation problems and also the unevenly distributed wealth , which result in some of the population being unable to benefit from the development of human society in terms of technology which improves life quality .
In conclusion , the rising life expectancies can be considered both challenge and achievement .
Ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries .
As the standard of living increases , the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies , which have advanced over the decades , among the general public , has become increasingly available .
People of the nations are likely to be well taken care of , partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective government .
In the following , I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion .
Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs .
There is a Chinese saying that goes , " Jia you yi lao , ru you yi bao " .
This means having an elderly person at home is equivalent to having a good time at home .
Where every home houses an elderly person , the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and moral values .
Where filial piety and respect for the elder are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions , the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as for their parents .
With good communication and interaction , an elderly person can guide the young with valuable lessons in life .
An individual is a unit of society , every good individual , this is a precious contribution to society and the nation 's growth .
On the other hand , the rising life expectancy can also be an indication , though not entirely , of a country 's reputation for its citizens .
A longlived and healthy individual is sometimes being related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received .
In other words , it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective , well managed by the Government .
This gives credits to the Government 's medical and healthcare schemes .
Thus , rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government 's well-planned or managed schemes .
However , this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates to a nation 's provision of quality healthcare benefits and livings for senior citizens .
The ageing population is often viewed negatively by developed countries where they are economic driven .
In order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders economic development , more physically capable and young workforces are required in society .
If failed to fulfil this requirement , this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the society or company working groups .
This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government , decreasing birth rates where people can not afford the children 's expenses of their upbringings and educational fees , that adds to more burdens and worries for the government .
As an overall result , the rising life expectancies can be considered as a pro and cons to the country .
Pro , in terms of the intangible aspects such as emotional and mental development of the future generations and contribution to a country 's well - being .
Con , on the other hand , in terms of tangible aspects mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world .
The rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human beings could be medically disturbing .
These few problems were taking a toll on human lives over the years when they were over 60 years of age .
Most of the illness lies with mental illness , musculoskeletal pain and sight and hearing loss .
It is a challenge where this illness ca n't be easily avoided by any person in such a stressful lifestyle in any place in the world .
Medical advances which help in curing this illness were also getting better over the years , which helped with the rise in life expectancy .
When a person grows old , the medical needs of a person increase over the years relative to the age of a person .
The number and types of illness also increase relative to the age too .
This is particularly seen in many parts of the world .
As a result of stress , the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of the environment were getting worse .
More variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human .
More challenges also include the environmental challenges that are seen over the years .
By the rate of environmental damage , we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being had to be changed .
These changes and damages also increase the chances of contracting more illness as we age .
Therefore , the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living , which is a huge challenge .
The ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical ability to solve and eliminate the harm that is able to take the life of a human away at an earlier age .
This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now .
All these technological advancements also help to improve the lives of the human race in terms of improving the lifestyle , environment and medical ability .
Therefore , achieving such great freedom in these areas is considered as an achievement where human lives are then improved and extended to the life of us .
Moreover , achieving the near impossible to eliminate all illnesses such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement for the human race .
This step needs the ability to take a long time of research to make it possible .
Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human beings .
In conclusion , we could see that in order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illness that could be growing over the years , the damage to our living environment and stresses that are always building in city life .
There is always a way out where the achievements were done by humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy .
Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
We should separate it into two aspects .
The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge .
The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement .
They are not contracting with each other .
In my opinion , the challenge of interception is to make comparisons in the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation .
On the other hand , the achievement perceived is to make comparisons in the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past .
So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .
We should imagine that when life expectancies are raised up , this will mean that the average age for the population in nationwide or globally is also rising .
The number of older people will increase to make the average life expectancy higher .
For these older people , society needs man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .
Sometimes , older people need more manpower and resources than normal young people .
However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for society .
We have to say that older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources .
So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
Not only has the family members of the old people , but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such a situation .
This is the interpretation of the challenge for rising life expectancies .
For the second part , rising life expectancies is also an achievement .
The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history of the past .
In ancient times , due to the development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care of their health .
Hence , people have died of various diseases .
On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .
People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .
These small things make the quality of people 's lives less enjoyable than today .
Bad mood can not give them a longer time of life .
For all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
So , the mark for how long is life expectancy is indicating how well people are living .
In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
From these points , we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .
Besides , we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder , the older people .
We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old .
In such a situation , society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way .
We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement .
As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , how to make life easier , comfortable as well as healthy has been shed light on .
Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem .
However , there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement .
Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on the development of medication .
There are a series of diseases that hinder longevity .
Cancer , as a major group of killing diseases , is often beyond current medication to get fully healed .
Once cancers are too late to be discovered , one is deemed to death at a later stage .
Other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers , but the current medication does have methods to treat the patient , but risks still come along .
Apart from diseases themselves , deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer .
Patients in many developing and less developed countries , especially African countries , are suffering from simple and easy - to - treat diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life , albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where the medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .
To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system .
Governments should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete education systems .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
The development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable .
Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved , people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandise in factories .
Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor .
Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long - time shipments .
As a result , people have more time to enjoy the advantage of modern life .
One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see the beautiful scenery that one dreams of his lifetime .
One can also easily see his deeply loved one through the internet from miles away .
More importantly , they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through the Internet , to make more interested people get involved and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful .
The development of technology brings people joy , making things easier and this may be one of the achievements .
In conclusion , it is delighted to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising , but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy .
There are a series of problems that hinder longevity , such as current medication .
But data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life .
As for the future , who knows ?
We are on the right track .
Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future .
In recent decades , it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life .
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living conditions .
While it is applaudable that people have achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posed by the rising life expectancy .
Without a doubt , the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases .
The condition of the living environment is also improved so that people are able to live in more hygienic places .
The improvement in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works .
Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to groundbreaking living environments , are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work .
The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter in the history of human civilisation .
However , as life expectancy rises , some social challenges occur as well .
As the aging population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to more support from people of an old age .
This creates a huge social burden for them and might cause some of them to leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .
This would result in the loss of manpower in a country .
Another aspect would be that , as young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves .
This would result in a decrease in the birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem , especially in more developed countries , as the population has already reached a minimum .
The government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare for the old people because they are in urgent need of it .
Less money will be left to develop the country and explore new areas of business .
This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country .
After all , it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows , especially in developed countries with a very small population .
However , when we look at the brighter side of reality , the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solves many problems we had in the past . There is hope that the aging population may transform into a helpful force for a country in the future with the help of better technology and education .
Life expectancy can be defined as the desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .
People in the current era are described as demanding or having a high level of life expectancy in another world .
They are expecting better education , healthier food , and a cleaner environment and so on and so forth .
However , this rising life expectancy has become a challenge and also an achievement in the ageing population .
Percentage of elderly people is increasing annually according to the United Nations ' projection .
In another word , there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compared to younger people in this world population .
On the other hand , people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as the newer I-Pad model .
In fact , these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and highly productive than in the past .
However , the ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it .
Ageing population leads to a working force composed of a larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet life expectancy .
The second life expectancy is increased by medical technology and resources .
Ageing population requires more medical sources , since elderly people need more medical attention .
However , the health level of the world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in the number of elderly worldwide .
Nevertheless , provision of more medicine and better equipment as well as more medical centres is necessary to accommodate these elders .
Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price , which is raised by the younger generation .
Ageing is a consequence of increasing the health level of the population .
The concurrent result is the increasing size of the population .
When the elders live longer , the family size actually increases rather than decreases .
In addition , the younger generation is eager to start their own family in another place rather than staying together with family .
This phenomenon increases the demand for land property and subsequently affects their price and size together .
Increasing the size of the population also leads to a problem in food supply .
The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compared to the population 's growth rate , which will end up with insufficient food in the future .
Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments .
People expect more on the ground of their current economy , life stability and desire .
For example , one would like to have an iPhone 5 in the past , but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate at faster speed after using it for a while .
Thus , the rising expectations actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people 's lives and indirectly reflect the ability of government to provide people with their current comforts , economic status , convenience and others .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement but it poses more challenges to government and people .
All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges on the way to meeting expectations .
Otherwise , the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered down when the time passes or people should lower their expectations of life .
People 's average age has become longer compared to the past .
From one perspective , it shows that medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different diseases .
From another perspective , there are more and more older people but less younger ones . The increase in population age has weakened the labor force and so on .
In my opinion , the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement .
Firstly , the ageing population can definitely be viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology .
Comparing technology today and the past , we can see that a lot of diseases are treatable , the number of people that died because of the diseases that are not treatable decreases .
The fast development of medicine and technological products makes people 's lives much healthier compared to the past .
Moreover , the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters .
People are able to predict some disasters like the earthquake and do the prevention beforehand .
Although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies , it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement .
Technology is always improving and it never stops , and the lifespan of people is getting longer as well .
Thus , we should not compare it now with the past , but we need to be worried about the future problems caused by this situation .
The first challenge is the decreasing number of newborns .
As the population ageing is growing , as people get old , they need to be cared for by others and are not able to contribute as much as they were young .
If the number of old people is too much and there is a lesser number of younger people , it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less , the productivity and technology improvements will be less .
At the same time , more people are needed to take care of the old ones , which gives the younger generation extra work .
The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources .
As we know that the population of humans continues to grow year by year , we are using nonrecoverable natural resources in everyday life . For example , oil , people 's lives and technology improvements are not able to continue without the usage of oil .
However , these natural resources are not renewable .
We do not consider much for our offspring .
Ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left in what will be the life of our next generation .
The increase in the population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think of some ideas like to prevent using too much natural resources .
In conclusion , the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges , like lack of young generation .
We have to consider more about our future generation , be aware of the problems that over aging has brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges .
Soon after coming into the industrial age , humans released the weapon and brought up a new technological era .
An improvement in engineering and medical science has been valued since humanism arises .
Studies have shown that the average life span of human beings is rising gradually over the years , in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps humans to live longer and enjoy the world even more .
In spite of that , people should be aware that the power of science is not almighty , life will still go to their last page without revelation .
Since not all of the human beings are going to be a doctor , people realise the skills of treatment of doctors and hence , they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health .
There is needless to doubt that medical technology has enhanced day by day .
In the past , when people were injured or fell into sickness , there is no guarantee that people would get well treatment and fully recovered . Therefore , people could easily die if infected by a small disease .
With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays , humans live longer and hence , a great increase in the population .
It would be great if life expectancies keep rising day by day , but in reality , it does not seem to be so easy .
Firstly , although the treatment is reliable , people would still need to have an awareness of their own health condition .
There are millions of doctors all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .
Nowadays , the pressure from the head of a company towards those employees means that people have to be fully concentrated on their jobs and , because of that , people start to ignore their health conditions and rely on treatment and supplements .
Pressure can really cause sickness just like viruses and germs and it is more like a chronic disease .
It is like a key that opens up the gate of the human body defense system and provides a cleared path for other diseases to attack in .
Therefore , when the era is improving itself , the disease does it too .
It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keep the life span to grow as people get sick every moment .
Nevertheless , humans still need improvement .
By comparing the past , it is a big step forward in the development of medical science .
In the era of Warring State , warriors lose their arms or legs or even all of them .
The rest of their life has to be relied on by their family and the financial support from others .
Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them have chosen to commit suicide without giving trouble to others .
Nowadays , things have changed .
Disabled people walk with artificial legs , men can get pregnant , even the sexual orientation of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery .
It is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history .
In conclusion , the reason why population ageing is an increasing majority is due to the great improvement of global medical science .
It is a challenge but also an achievement .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon that arises in both developed and developing countries .
Average life spans rose from 45 years old in 1920s to over 65 years old in 2010s .
In the social science report last year , this number will further increase to 90 years old in the 2080s due to the advance of medical technology and better living standards .
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in society and the proportion of working adults is decreased .
It may cost a higher social cost burden , which further leads to the allocation of funds in the government 's yearly budget .
Medical expenses , EPF and accommodation are the costs which directly involve the old people .
It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the living of old people .
Otherwise , there are more and more people staying on the street and destroying the good view of Garden City .
In addition , it is also a challenge for government , family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial .
With the moral of filial , most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life .
It is to prevent them from sending them to old folk 's houses and do not visit them at all .
We also do not want to see the happening of the worst things that parents are trapped by children along the streets and let them die themselves .
It may be a challenge but also a golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes .
Life expectancies rise significantly from the past to recent in the whole world .
It is the outcome of advanced medical technology , changing lifestyles and higher living standards .
However , among the underdeveloped countries , developing countries and developed countries , we found that there is the longest life span in the developed countries followed by the developing countries and the shortest life span in underdeveloped countries .
The observation means that the more developed the countries , the longer the life span of citizens .
In other words , it can also be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population .
It is proud to have an ageing population which is hard to achieve unless there is advanced medical technology and a higher living standard .
Besides that , the ageing population has an important and essential thing that we can not buy in cash .
There is experience in life .
During the work , the supervisor usually asks the so - called " old staff ' to lead the newbie .
It shows that this is a significant case of the importance of experience .
With the existing experience , we can do the work more quickly without sacrificing the standard and quality .
It may lead to shorter ways to make the decision and provide more sales and revenue for the company .
The economy of this country is boosted and further leads to new development and a rise in our living standard .
In conclusion , there are challenges as well as achievements in the rising life expectancies which we can not exclude .
Therefore , we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement of creating a new life for our next generation .
In 1712 , Watt renovated the steam machine which increased the efficiency of the fuel .
This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution .
As technology develops faster and faster during 301 years , people not only enjoy more and more materials , but also more and more health care , which provides convenience in our daily life .
This significantly raised people 's average life expectancy .
However , as the life expectancy of people rises , the ageing population problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
As the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a standard measure of the pace of technology development , it can be seen as an achievement of human beings .
However , as the energy and resources use up , more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crops on earth will aggravate the ageing problem , so the rise of life expectancy can also be seen as a challenge .
As we are humans who are different from other animals , we have some basic rights , like right to privacy , right to live , right to have a family and so on .
Among these basic rights , the most important one is the right to live .
During the less developed times , due to disasters like droughts , floods or severe contagious diseases like black deaths , people at that time could lose their property and lives easily , since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time .
However , as technology develops , it increases people 's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies .
As we can use resources with maximum efficiency , we can enjoy more and more life material than at any time in human society .
Even when the disaster comes , we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time than before .
For example , the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is " the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II " as CNN commented .
( CNN , 2011 ) -- However , only one year has passed , most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory .
This is not imaginable during less developed times .
With the strong support of technology , the rise in life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society .
However , along with the increase in life expectancies , ageing problems become more and more severe .
Two of the most important causes of ageing problems is the increasing longevity and declining fertility .
The increasing longevity is due to the fast development of society so as the living pressure .
The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility .
As people who are incapable of production become more and more mature , our society follows a downward trend .
Moreover , as we use up more and more resources , what we have left may not be enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resources to do research into developing new technology .
Therefore , the increase in life expectancies is also a great challenge .
As we have mentioned above , the increase in life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge .
In the modern world , many global issues have appeared , like global warming , the concept of the earth 's village and the population .
Nowadays , population aging is becoming a problem , especially in the developed countries .
Now in Singapore , we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown .
Population ageing also has brought us a question of whether we should raise life expectancies , but it is challenging we can also get some achievement .
In the first place , rising life expectancies could cause resources challenges .
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong , if people still increase humans ' lives , but for these small developed regions , resources are very limited , especially land .
Because the land is limited , so the average land for one person is very small already .
Some years ago , there was a report on Hong Kong citizens ' living situation . In a small room there are eight people , they can not do anything in the room , they can only sleep and the air in the room is very bad .
So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger , and more people will have limited resources .
In the economy , we can use GDP to explain the challenge . If GDP is low , it shows that most people are living in a hard life , life quality is bad , then it will cause terrible society problems . Finally , it will cause society disturbance .
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated natural regulations .
On the other hand , rising life expectancies could bring some achievements .
People 's quality of life has been better now . In order to continue improving , people have begun to consider how to raise their lives .
Because life and health are most significant , people have their own reasons to hope to live longer .
In medicine , people have done a lot of research on life science .
Also , people begin to realize the importance of the environment , how to protect people from harmful air .
So , according to humanism , people should make a contribution to raising human life , because people should consider the feelings of one day when you are becoming older and older , so respecting life should be considered carefully .
In addition , now there appears a contradiction in rising life expectancies , it will lead to a resources problem .
However , based on humanism , humans are different from the animals , people should respect every life .
In my opinion , I think we should study and balance it well . One side , we should continue to make efforts to raise human life . One side , we should consider using asking some sick old men whether they want to take euthanasia .
To summary , we respect every life , and also help people to live longer .
In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , although global aging issues have become more serious in human development , if we can balance and understand why we live .
They try to invent new energy and legitimately control the population 's birth rate , then develop medical treatment and paying enough attention . We have reasons to trust that population aging will not be a problem at all .
Population ageing : A more and more attention - getting topic
Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding it are arising .
Due to the rise of the life span and the shrinkage of the birth rate , the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger .
As our society develops , people have a much higher living standard , which will reduce the chance of getting disease .
Besides , as with the development of technology , medical therapy also has made tremendous progress .
Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now .
Therefore , the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive .
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of people died annually .
On the other hand , the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing , whose figure is the lowest record compared to the previous figure .
Maybe it is because modern society is becoming more and more competitive . The parents are paying a lot of attention and importance to their career .
They do not want to bother to spend so much time raising and nurturing children .
Maybe that 's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate .
The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
This survey evidently shows that big achievements have been made in the medical area and people 's living standard has been improved .
It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically growing .
Yet , do not be confused by this superficial amount of achievement .
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
First , if older people increase , there will be fewer workforces that can support society .
However , the ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure .
The most important part is health care and older pensions .
Like elderly people , they need more money for health care than the younger .
Governments should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
Secondly , for older people , more facilities and services for them should be provided .
So more manpower will be employed , which reduces labour in other areas .
Of course , more money will be spent .
To pay this extra money , the government will exert higher taxes on the other people .
Thirdly , compared to the young people , the security of the elderly is more notable .
Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injuries .
Therefore , some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
To conclude , the ageing population phenomenon indeed shows our big achievements in the economy , medical skills and living standards .
Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to society and government .
More facilities and services will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
Definitely , we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully .
Whereas , for the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement because it is an evidence of the progress of modern medical technology and , meanwhile , it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large a population .
It is natural that rising life expectancies is regarded as an achievement .
The goal of every species of living things is to increase the quantity of these species .
Humankind is not an exception .
People with rising life expectancies can ensure a large population and large species of human beings .
It is more secure for us because , in a potential sense , we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out .
Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology .
For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is general .
Rising life expectancies can bring us a more skilled workforce because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person .
A longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over .
Thus , it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for a long time rather than training fresh men .
Rising life expectancies can be a challenge .
There are two possibilities .
On the one hand , if there are fewer young people and more old people , lacking work force problems will arise .
On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancies will cause a larger population .
We talk about the first possibility .
If there are less young people and more old people , as in both Singapore and China , when elderly people retire , there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions .
Thus , there will be a lack of labor force , which will lead to a decreasing speed of development in the country .
Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankrupt , and thus people 's living conditions will definitely get worse .
The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with the large population , but due to the " only child " policy , we have no benefits from a large population in the future .
With a low birth rate , Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country .
If there are more young people , then there will be even more elderly people with rising life expectancies in the future definitely .
Population is large , while resources are limited , which will incur many problems , such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
Expansion of the population can not continue like that because resources are limited , and we will end up dying out after using up all resources .
To sum up , with rising life expectancies , there exist both achievement and challenge .
It is the progress of human beings that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies , but it also has a potential crisis for either nation or the human being .
We can either step back to maintain the population with some methods , or step forward to search for more resources in outer space .
Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations . It requires at least three conditions to happen : advanced health care systems , reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
However , when it happens , it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labor costs to society .
If a country can bear an ageing population , it is a thing that the country can be proud of .
In the first place , it must have grasped the advanced health care system .
Ageing is in essence a problem of worsening bodies .
With increasing age , people become more prone to disease and injury , and more difficult to recover .
Without an advanced health care system , aged people have a higher rate of death .
In fact , this was the major limitation of people 's average life span in the past .
With advanced medical technology , not only many diseases can be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
If the developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would also be helpful to reduce the negative side effects , which include reducing the hazards from the environment .
Health care by far has been expensive to carry out .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would not be sufficient medical resources for usage .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
A major source of the hazards is pollution .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habit and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed most .
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system , they do require software to function , which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
When people become old , most of them join a weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people .
If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but does not grant access to them to its senior citizens , it just does not help .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
Only when there is a ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can the aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
With the glory , there comes problems .
To take care of old people , facilities such as nursing homes should be built , which add on to the expense of society .
An even larger share of the old people 's expense lies in health care .
In addition , old people are weakened in many respects , thus they are usually not considered as labors .
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , labor is considered to become less and each labor needs to pay more for the welfare of old people .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society , including at least advanced health care systems , reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
" The weak is meat and the strong eat it " does not apply nowadays .
The advanced technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rule and cycle , which is a big challenge faced by human beings .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or stories written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories who lived longer than 80 years old .
They may die for hunger , die from illness or just go to bed as usual but never wake up again .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things that should be celebrated ; one is red and one is white .
Here , the red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away .
The first time I read this saying , I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that , in the past , it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness of your young relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past .
Now , technology and science develop at an unbelievably fast pace .
There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past and vanished in the world .
Even though people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live .
Besides illness , the improvement of technology generates more food , both in quantity and in quality .
At the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high - level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one .
It is a breakthrough of technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy life , it sounds like perfect , but we must face the reality -- there is no Utopia .
Before people find another planet to live , the earth is the only habitat for us , and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings , it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live .
People 's lifetime rising means that the time of the cycle of generation rises .
Furthermore , thanks to the development of technology , the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing , accelerating population aging and increasing .
To our disappointment , now technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources .
Moreover , the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing .
Before robots can fully replace labor , the decrease in generating power indicates less creativity and less goods available for us to use .
It is such a challenge that human beings can not avoid and must solve .
The only way is to develop technology , but the chance to develop is based on people 's wisdom and creativity , which is decreasing due to population aging .
The world is always fair to us .
While we are celebrating for the breakthrough of our way to Utopia , we are suffering to facing a new challenge .
We can not give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way we die and reborn .
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so as to increase the capacity of our planet .
As the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Moreover , life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy .
However , while we are enjoying the fruits carried by the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious , which has gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the resource allocation .
Therefore , rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
On one side , we can not deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancy .
The reason why life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Since we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
And that is what we are striving for .
So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves .
On the other hand , we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by the rise in life expectancy .
Since we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality , we are leading a longer life .
This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight .
However , during the process of making development for our lives , we decide to reduce the rapid growth of the population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down .
This also works and we have also seen the effect .
Then there comes a problem .
Because the birth rate is reduced , while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased .
So the population is getting more and more aged .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated the burden of society .
Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
Taken together , we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sides .
It has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
The significance of our existence is leading to a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world .
There is no absolute perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Therefore , we need to continue on our driving as we try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried out .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
It is well known that statistics , generally , as a country develops , life expectancies increase .
This is the result of better quality of life ; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitation and advanced healthcare .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
Better sanitation will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual 's existence on earth .
Examples of how advanced health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies , and hence they also illustrate why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement .
It is remarkable that the population aged 60 and over is increasing from 2 % to 3 % annually in developing countries as well .
It is highly plausible that the results for the increase are the same as in developed countries .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
Fewer famines , better sanitation and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century 's greatest achievement as a global society .
However , an aging population is taking on a country .
Although life expectancies may increase significantly , the population 's overall productivity may not increase linearly .
They will end up putting a burden on society that they have been contributing to their whole working career .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one 's constitution weakens as one ages .
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain ; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consume large quantities of energy .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
Large quantities of energy are needed for pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produced around the globe .
If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increased in order to keep increasing life expectancy , it will continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
The challenge will be to increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
The rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the product of rising quality of life ; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat a balanced diet to make them healthier .
As a result , the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now .
By projections of the United Nations , it is shown that the population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2 % to 3 % in the developed and developing countries , respectively .
The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
However , as there is only limited space and resources on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all people worldwide .
Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement .
Back to the ancient days , when human beings first appeared on the earth , the average life expectancy is only less than 20 .
The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , the lack of medicine .
With the development of society , in the past thousands of years , technology is progressing and the concern for health is rising , so that higher life expectancies are achieved .
With more advanced technology in the medicine area , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
This situation is a major progress from ancient times and also a big achievement by all human beings .
However , since the space and resources on earth are very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
However , the need for food is also increasing , so that the competition might become even more frightening .
What 's worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
Many violence happening in the Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resources .
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even more serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
In a word , the rise in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings .
The advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth are also a big challenge .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
With the development of modern society , people live longer .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 , according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
In developed countries like Japan and Switzerland , life expectancy can be as high as more than 80 .
Normally , people will regard extended life expectations as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of countries .
However , as the population is ageing , the challenges such as increased medical costs and shortage of workforce are also realized .
In a nutshell , rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standards and medical care , countless people 's lives are extended .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Without life , we have nothing .
In the long history of evolution , we are always struggling for life against staving and illness .
In the last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
We are modernized and we have gained improved living standards and medical care .
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness .
In ancient times , the residents may only live for 30 years , but now , the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries .
With a double lifetime , humans can have a chance to explore the real meaning of life .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man 's life .
Hence , the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
On the other hand , the aging of the population can also be a challenge to society .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
That is the natural law which nobody can violate .
Hence , when the ratio of seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to society can not be neglected anymore .
First , the medical cost will rise greatly .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupted because of illness .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
Second , the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of society .
Japan 's society is now facing severe ageing problems , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
There has been a report estimated that in the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work .
The same situation is happening around the world .
Obviously , rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge .
To conclude , the rising life expectancies must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
The ageing population is now a heated expression in individuals ' lives .
These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
When mentioning the ageing population , the media always consider it as a social problem .
It is remarkable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but at the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
Following are the more specific explanations .
The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems .
Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and their brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to society .
In addition , elderly people are using the same or even more amount of social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
Furthermore , to make living , many senior citizens go back to work .
It will also induce many problems .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficiently and which will lead to a low effective output .
To make him or her more competitive so that they can not be beat by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonuses .
This may lead to the younger generation 's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standards to reduce the daily cost .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard ; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness levels and drive the whole society into a less stable situation .
There are also some older people who live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
They can live a happy life , but actually , for society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets , which may become a resistance to positive social change .
Above all , population aging will be a great challenge for the world because it drags on the development of a society .
However , the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement for human society .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accidents , diseases or suicides .
A long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face life full of problems .
For the whole society , rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advanced science and technology , especially in the medical field , a better social environment and a safer world .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it an achievement .
Every coin has two sides .
The rising life expectancies are like a two - side sword to the modern world .
It can cause many problems , but it also means a lot to human beings .
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and , at the same time , appreciate its great meanings .
Rising Life Expectancies , Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
The rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Obviously , rising life expectancy is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology , insurance conditions , culture development , and our social system , which shows the improvement of people 's quality of life .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
This is a great achievement made by the younger generation .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
With the population ageing and the increasing portion of the old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
For individuals , since people 's life expectancies are becoming longer , there will be more trouble for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their livings ; they may feel lonely , especially if their spouses die ; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
For families , certainly , the burden for young people is becoming heavier .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
That means when the child grows up , they need to take care of both parents .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people , since their grandparents also live with them .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and fewer people can work for society , this society may lack labour .
And at the same time , these old people take up a larger portion of the resources and budgets of this society .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people 's lives .
Also , the ageing population calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology , a higher level of civilization in our lives .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization can not match our material aspect , old people will have a tough twilight years .
Now population aging is a trend .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge for us to face the new situation .
Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened .
In the old times , people could easily lose their lives due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy led to a nationwide hunger strike .
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals .
Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Not long from now SARS , as blurry as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before humans took action .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
The war kills a lot of people , which is not doubtful .
After going through WW1 and WW2 , the population on the earth got much fewer .
No matter because technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just did n't live a long life .
Hence , as technology , especially in the medical field , continues to get developed and updated , people do n't risk their lives anymore .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in the field .
With modern machines and growing methods , humans do n't need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
All the achievements humans have influenced the lifespan of people .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of society though .
As society develops , people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government , society 's balance is broken .
It is difficult to keep the economy functioning well .
Times change , people change .
Many young people do n't view things like their parents used to do .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
With a more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
They pull up the age to retire .
No matter what measures they take , the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
